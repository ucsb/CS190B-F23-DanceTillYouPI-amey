# CS190B-F23-DanceTillYouPI-amey

Dance Till You Pi is a play on the phrase, “Dance till you die”. Inspired by games we love playing in arcades, such as "Dance Dance Revolution," or DDR, this is a mini version of such rhythm/timing games! Dance Till You Pi game rewards players with good coordination, reaction time, and a musical ear. React to the colored light flash and press the matching colored buttons on every beat! In contrast to typical DDR games, which are large and expensive, our version is much more compact and can be enjoyed from the comfort of your room!
