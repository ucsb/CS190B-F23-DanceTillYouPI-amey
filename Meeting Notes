Brainstorm:
- IOT aspect
  - We want to be able to display the scoreboard and send the scores to other people / an online database
- Need to buy
  - Force sensitive resistor pads 
- Questions
  - Do we want to make a mini version of the DDR pad so it works with 2 fingers
    - Pros: makes it easier to build, cheaper
    - Cons: tiny, probably not as fun
  - Meeting times:
    - Tuesday and Thursday 11-12
- Basic Timeline:
  - Week 5 (10/29 - 11/4)
    - Finalize project idea (small finger board vs large feet board)
    - Before next meeting, 
  - Week 6 (11/5 - 11/11)
    - Purchase parts
  - Week 7 (11/12 - 11/18)
